# CLARO
CLARO – CrisisGuard is a rule-based fake news verification web application designed for crisis situations.
It helps users evaluate the credibility of emergency-related messages before sharing, without censorship or content deletion.

The system uses transparent, explainable rules such as panic language detection, trusted source presence, message length, and crisis relevance to generate a credibility score and clear explanations.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, CLARO focuses on ethical, user-assistive decision making rather than automated truth enforcement.

Rules applied include:

Detection of panic or urgent language

Identification of trusted sources

Minimum content length for context

Crisis relevance check

Each rule transparently affects the final credibility score, which represents risk level, not absolute truth.

CLARO does not decide what is true or false.
It assists users by explaining credibility risks and encourages responsible sharing during crisis situations.
