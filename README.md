# CLARO
CLARO – CrisisGuard is a rule-based fake news verification web application designed for crisis situations.
It helps users evaluate the credibility of emergency-related messages before sharing, without censorship or content deletion.

The system uses transparent, explainable rules such as panic language detection, trusted source presence, message length, and crisis relevance to generate a credibility score and clear explanations.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, CLARO focuses on ethical, user-assistive decision making rather than automated truth enforcement.
